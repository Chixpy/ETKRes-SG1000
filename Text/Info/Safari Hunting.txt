As a hunter, your job is to shoot as many wildlife in three woodland areas as you can until you are out of ammo. The wildlife include pumas, spiders, rabbits, armadillo, bats, bears, and monkeys. There is a catch, however: you must get over the qualifying score in order to go to the next round, or the game ends. The qualifying score gets higher for each round you complete. There are 69 rounds to complete.
